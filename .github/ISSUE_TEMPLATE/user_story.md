## A good user story should follow the I-N-V-E-S-T principle

- _Independent_ (from other user stories, allowing to realize them in any order);
- _Negotiable_ (omit details that would freeze the story);
- _Valuable_ (implementation delivers an increment of functionality, observable by and useful to users);
- _Estimable_ (developers should be able to estimate its size relative to other stories);
- _Sizable_ (implementation fits in one iteration - if it needs many to complete, it is an EPIC);
- _Testable_ (user must be able to check the conditions of satisfaction).

## Description

- As a "role", I'd like to "feature short description" [ , in order to "value it adds"]

## Acceptance Criteria

Reference: [Definition of Done](../../docs/EngineeringPractices.md)

- [ ] Should "testable condition that should be satisfied"
- [ ] Should "testable condition that should be satisfied"

Also, here are a few points that need to be addressed:

- Constraint 1
- Constraint 2
- Constraint 3

## Resources

- Technical Design Document
- Mockups

## Tasks

**_Assignee should break down work into tasks here_**

- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
