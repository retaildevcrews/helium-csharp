The sole purpose of this file is to cause the Azure DevOps pipeline to run without actually changing any source code.

Simply add or remove a space or CR and PR into master and the pipeline will run if it's setup.

Changes to doc files will run the pipeline but will NOT publish to ACR as no code was changed.

This file can safely be deleted.
